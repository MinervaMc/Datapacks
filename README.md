#### Commands:
All of the trigger commands are in the form of `/trigger .<name>` (defaults to value 1)\
When a number means something you'll need to use `/trigger .<name> set [num]`

##### Scoreboard
 - Toggle the scoreboard cycle: `.SbCycle`
 - Set a specific scoreboard: `.StatName` will set the StatName scoreboard (eg: `.Deaths`)
 - Clear the sidebar: `.clear`
 - Change the player colors: `.color set [num]`, color codes can be looked up [here](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Formatting_codes)

##### Tps & Entity counter
To show & update the debug scoreboard for N seconds: `.Debug set [seconds]` (max: 60).\
Don't trust first second result, always set it for a few secs.\
You should disable the sb cycle, or debug sb will get overridden every 5s by the cycle.

The player-specific entity counter can be triggered via `/function tools:entity_count` (OP only)

##### Unicorn 
The `.Unicorn` trigger will toggle the horn, accepted values:
 1. end_rod
 2. button
 3. glass
 4. lead
 
##### Spectator
To toggle between survival and spectator you can use the `.Spectator` trigger, when leaving spectator mode you will be placed where you entered spectator mode.
It will only allow you to go into spectator if you are not taking damage/falling/drowning
